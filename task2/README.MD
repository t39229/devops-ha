This YAML file is an AWS CloudFormation template designed to set up a network infrastructure with a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, an EC2 instance, and an RDS database. Here's a breakdown of each section:

How to deploy:
Clone infrastructure2.yaml file on your local directory.
Login into AWS console, open CloudFormation service.
Click on Create stack and choose "Upload a template file" under Specify template.
Choose file and uplod infrastructure2.yaml and click Next.
Provide a stack name and click Next-->Next-->Submit
You can follow in progress of deploymnets in Resources and Output sections until it's change to CREATE_COMPLETED.
Verify your deploymnet by SSH into your instance in EC2.
You can destroy your Stack by clicking on Delete Stack.


General Information
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: Specifies the version of the CloudFormation template format being used.
Description: Provides a brief description of what the template does.
Resources
This section defines all the AWS resources that will be created.

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

VPC: Creates a VPC with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16. DNS support and hostnames are enabled, and it is tagged with a name.
Subnets

PublicSubnet: A public subnet with a CIDR block of 10.0.1.0/24 is created. It is configured to automatically assign public IPs to instances launched within it.
PrivateSubnet1 and PrivateSubnet2: Two private subnets with CIDR blocks 10.0.2.0/24 and 10.0.3.0/24 respectively. They are placed in different availability zones for redundancy.
Internet Gateway and Route Tables

InternetGateway: Creates an internet gateway to allow internet access.
AttachGateway: Attaches the internet gateway to the VPC.
PublicRouteTable: A route table for the public subnet.
PublicRoute: Adds a route to the route table that directs all outbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the internet gateway.
PublicSubnetRouteTableAssociation: Associates the public subnet with the public route table.
Security Groups

EC2SecurityGroup: Allows HTTP access (port 80) from anywhere to the EC2 instance.
RDSSecurityGroup: Allows MySQL access (port 3306) from the EC2 instance to the RDS database.
EC2 Instance

EC2Instance: Launches an EC2 instance of type t3.micro in the public subnet. It uses a specified Amazon Linux 2 AMI and is associated with the EC2SecurityGroup.
RDS Database

RDSInstance: Creates an RDS database instance of type db.t3.micro with MySQL as the engine. It is configured with a database name, master username, and password. The instance is secured by the RDSSecurityGroup and uses a specified DB subnet group.
DBSubnetGroup: Defines a subnet group for the RDS instance, using the two private subnets for high availability.
Outputs
This section provides information about the resources created, which can be useful for other CloudFormation stacks or for users.

InstanceId: Outputs the ID of the EC2 instance.
DBEndpoint: Outputs the endpoint address of the RDS database, which is necessary for connecting to the database.
