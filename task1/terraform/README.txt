# This configuration does the following:

# 1. Creates a VPC with public and private subnets.
# 2. Sets up firewall rules to allow HTTP traffic (port 80) to the VM and communication between the VM and the database (port 3306 for MySQL).
# 3. Creates a VM instance in the public subnet with Nginx installed.
# 4. Creates a Cloud SQL MySQL instance in the private subnet.
# 5. Creates a database and a user for the database.
# 6. Outputs the public IP of the VM and the private IP of the database.

# To use this configuration:

# 1. Replace `your-project-id` with your actual GCP project ID.
# 2. Save the code in a file named `main.tf`.
# 3. Run `terraform init` to initialize Terraform.
# 4. Run `terraform plan` to see the execution plan.
# 5. Run `terraform apply` to create the resources.

# Important notes:

# - The database password is set to "change-me". You should change this to a secure password.
# - The `deletion_protection` for the database is set to `false` for easy cleanup. In a production environment, you should set this to `true`.
# - The VM has a public IP for easy access, but in a production environment, you might want to use a bastion host or VPN for secure access.
# - This setup allows the VM to connect to the database, but you'll need to configure your application to use the correct connection details.
# - Remember to run `terraform destroy` when you're done to avoid unnecessary charges.

# This configuration provides a basic setup. Depending on your specific needs, you might want to add more security measure, configure backups for the database, set up monitoring, etc.
